the steps of using knn model in this project


# Details #
Note: the knn model in the project refers specifically to item-item knn model now, but the user-user knn may be added later

**the steps of using knn model in this project:**
  1. get the similarity matrix by (knn/getSim.cpp). Change the parameter before executing the programme.
  1. get k-max similarity for each item by (knn/getkmaxth.cpp). Specific the K before executing the programme.
  1. predcit the ratings and calculate the test set RMSE by (knn/knn\_ml.cpp)
